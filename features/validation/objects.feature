    # Unlike JSON, YAML allows numeric keys, which are treated as strings
    And it should accept:

      ```
      number: "1600"

      ```
      number: 1600
      street_name: Pennsylvania
      street_type: Avenue
      ```
    # Since additionalProperties is false, an extra property "direction" makes the object invalid:

      street_name: Pennsylvania
      street_type: Avenue
